# 🏠 Home 

Here lies all my infrastructure documentation for managing the home server stuff.

- [🔑 SSH keys](/posts/ssh-keys)
- [💾 Backup Managment](/posts/backup-management)

[Application Dashboard](http://192.168.1.196:5050/)

Currently all the infrastructure is ran by three servers. Each with different purposes.

1. [FreeNAS](/freenas)
2. [QNAP NAS](/qnap-nas)
3. [Raspberry Pi](/pi-server)
